# _printf - *Our custom version of the well known printf function*

## Description :

The _printf project is a custom implementation of the standard C library function printf. This function is designed to mimic the behavior of printf by formatting and printing data to the standard output based on a format string and a variable number of arguments.

The project demonstrates a deep understanding of variadic functions, memory management, and formatted output handling. It supports a variety of conversion specifiers and handles errors. This project was built during our fist year in Holberton school, and was our first group projet. 

# Features :
### The _printf function currently supports the following conversion specifiers:

| **Specifier** | **Description**                         | **Example**                | **Output**           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| `%c`          | Prints a single character              | `_printf("%c", 'A');`      | `A`                 |
| `%s`          | Prints a null-terminated string        | `_printf("%s", "Hello");`  | `Hello`             |
| `%d`          | Prints a signed decimal integer        | `_printf("%d", 42);`       | `42`                |
| `%i`          | Prints a signed decimal integer        | `_printf("%i", -42);`      | `-42`               |
| `%%`          | Prints a literal `%` character         | `_printf("%%");`           | `%`                 |

The function also handles unsupported specifiers by printing % followed by the unsupported character.
