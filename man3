Our _printf function is a custom version of the standard printf function. It shows formatted stdout, according to the format string, wich is the first argument we give to the function, followed by a number. The number is a variable argument. 

The format string contains regular characters (like for exemple 'A') and conversion specifiers, wich are identified by a %. These specifiers indicates how the arguments should be displayed in the stdout.

Supported specifiers :

Supported Conversion Specifiers:

%c : Prints a single character.
%s : Prints a null-terminated string.
%d : Prints a signed decimal integer.
%i : Prints a signed decimal integer (same as %d).
%% : Prints a literal % character.

Examples : 

_printf("Character: %c\n", 'A');

The output will be : 

Character: A

And for printing integers :

_printf("Integer: %d, Signed: %i\n", 42, -42);

The output will be : 

Integer: 42, Signed: -42
